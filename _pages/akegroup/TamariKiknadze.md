Tamari Bonowitz-Kiknadze received her bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Tbilisi State University, Georgia, 
where she was awarded the state scholarship seven times and a private scholarship once. She focused on physical 
and analytical chemistry, including enantioselective separations using capillary electrophoresis. Always interested 
in Germany and new research opportunities, she moved to Ruhr University Bochum to pursue a master’s degree in chemistry. 
She also gained experience as an analytical chemist in one of Georgia’s largest pharmaceutical companies.
