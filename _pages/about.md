<br/>
Our research focuses on the preparation, characterization and reactivity of small reactive intermediates and molecules related to interstellar media and prebiotic chemistry. 
For the preparation and spectroscopic characterization of these molecules we employ (in)organic synthesis, photolysis or high-vacuum flash pyrolysis in combination with cryogenic matrix isolation spectroscopy (IR, UV/Vis and EPR). 
All prepared molecular structures are validated by comparison of experimental and quantum chemical calculated properties. 
</p>


We are looking for highly motivated Bachelor and Master students interested in (in)organic synthesis, matrix isolation spectroscopy and/or computational chemistry to join our research group. Please contact Andr√© directly via e-mail.
